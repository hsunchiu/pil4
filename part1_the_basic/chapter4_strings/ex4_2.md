> Suppose you need to write a long sequence of arbitrary bytes as a literal string in Lua. What format would you use? Consider issues like readability, maximum line length, and size.


there are two method

* using **escapes** to link the long string,but it is hard to read,but the line length will be short and the add the size of code .
* using **[[ ]]**, it is readable,but it will take the a long length,and the size just add the `[[` and `]]` length.
