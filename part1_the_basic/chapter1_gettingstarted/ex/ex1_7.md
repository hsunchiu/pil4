I think is up on circumstances:	
if you use the expression as a **condition**,you can write it in that form:  

```
if x and y not z or not y and x then
	do 
		something()
	end
end
```
Because the precedence is **not** > **and** > **or**  

If your use the expression to get a true value,the parenthese is necessary,you can't ignore them.  
For example:

~~~
a = (x and y and (not) z) or ((not y) and x)
somthing()
~~~
