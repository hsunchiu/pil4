--[[
Sometimes, a language with proper-tail calls is called properly tail recursive, with the argu- ment that this property is relevant only when we have recursive calls. (Without recursive calls, the maxi- mum call depth of a program would be statically fixed.)
Show that this argument does not hold in a dynamic language like Lua: write a program that performs an unbounded call chain without recursion. (Hint: see the section called “Compilation”.)

In Lua 5.2, `load(ld)` loads a chunk. And if ld is a function, 
load calls it repeatedly to get the chunk pieces. Each call to
ld must return a string that concatenates with previous results. 
A return of an empty string, nil, or no value signals the end of the chunk.

Since `load` will repeatedly calls a function, we can use it to build
an unbounded call chain with random numbers.
